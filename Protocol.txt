Protocol description:
    - Upon establishing TCP connection, client sends UploadRequest message, then waits for response.
    - Server reads request and decides whether it can upload this file or not and replies with the
    corresponding UploadResponse.
    - If UploadResponse answers with ACCEPTED, then client starts to send file data via TCP connection.
    - When transmission is finished whether because of reaching end of stream or getting an error, server
    sends FinishResponse to a client and then closes the connection.
    - If UploadResponse answers with other than ACCEPTED, then server closes the connection.
